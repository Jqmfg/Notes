INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS

It a most basic level, a computer has three functions
	Input (user-provided input from a keyboard, mouse, etc. Sometimes can be provided from sources like a disk drive or the NIC)
	Processing (The computer responding to input by completing and action. The CPU does the processing and uses the RAM to manipulate variables)
	Output (Commonly provided to a printer or screen, although there can be other methods such as speakers or to disk drives when saving files)
e.g. Say you double click something on your computer, when you do that your comptuer
	Identifies the extension and opens it with the associated program.
	Locates that program in the hard drive memory and moves it into RAM
	From there, the computer actually runs the program
	The computer sends the results to the graphics card to show the process of the program starting
	When the program is started, the computer moves the file loaded into that program
	From here, the computer can start taking user input
Note: IPO computer troubleshooting can often be reduced to identifying what is not working (input, processing, or output.) This make make it much easier to troubleshoot.
The preceeding IPO process is constantly repeated.
Despite doing so much work, computers are still pretty dumb. They can only do what they are told to do.
They work with numbers very quickly.
Humans count numbers with the decimal system (1-10), but computers use binary.
									|		10^3		|		10^2		|		10^1		|		10^0
Decimal Value			|		1000		|		100			|		10			|		1
Number						|		2				|		3				|		5				|		7
Calculated Value	|		2000		|		300			|		50			|		7
The only difference between binary and decimal as that binary uses base 2 instead of base 10
A value of 1001 in decimal has a value of 9 in binary.
Although computers will always work in binary, it is usually easier for us to read them in what we call hexadecimal.
This uses the numbers 1-f for a total of 16 numbers.
