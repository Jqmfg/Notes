INTRODUCTION

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:
  Understand the histroy and philosophy of linux
  Describe the linux community
  Define the common terms associated with linux
  Understand the components of a linux distribution


SECTION 1: LINUX HISTORY

Linux is a free open-source computer OS intitially developed fo intel x86 personal computers
It has been ported to many other hardware platforms
Linux toravlds was a student in Finland in 1991 when started a project to write his own OS kernel
He also collected/developed the other parts to create and entire operation system with his kernel
This became known as the linux kernel
In 1992, linux was re-liscenced using the General Public License(GPL) by GNU (a project of the free software foundation (FSF))
This made it possible to build a worldwide community of developers
Numerous other developers created complete systems called linux distros in the mid-90s
The linux distros created in the mid-90s provided the basis for fully free computing
This became a driving force in the open-source community
In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced support for the linux platform and began their own development efforts
Today, Linux powers more than half the servers on the internet, android, and nearly all of the world's supercomputers


SECTION 2: LINUX PHILOSOPHY

Every organization or project has a philosophy that works as a guide while framing its objectives and creating its growth path
This section talks about the Linux philosophy and its impact on development
Linux is constantly enhanced and maintained by developers from all over th world collaborating over the internet
Linux Torvalds remains the head of all this
Technical skill and desire are the only qualifications for participating and contributing
Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operation system because it was meant to be an open-source version of UNIX
Files are stored in a heirarchical file system with the top of the system (root) being '/'
Linux always tries to make its components available via files or objects that look like files
Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects
They can often be worked on using the same utilities used for regular files
Linux is a fully multitasking, multiuser OS with built-in networking and service processes (daemons for the UNIX world)
You use Linux everyday
over 850,000 android phones are activated every day
nearly 700,000 tvs are sold every day, most of which run Linux
Google, facebook, twitter, and amazon are all powered by Linux
Linux is built collaboratively
This is the largest collaborative development project in human history
There are 15 million lines of code
1.5 million lines were written in the last couple of years
Linux is developed very quickly
A new kernel comes out every 2-3 months
When submitting code to the Linux kernel, patches are submitted
They can:
  rework things
  improve performance
  fix a problem
  add new support for a device
  add a new feature
Developers post their patches to the relevant mailing list
Patches are accepted by senior developers or maintainers
When the maintainer finishes their review, they will send the patch to Linus, who has ultimate authority on which patches are applied


SECTION 3: LINUX COMMUNITY
Suppose as part of your job you need to configure a Linux file server and you run into some difficulties
If you can't figure out the problem yourself, the Linux community can save the day
There are many ways to engage with the Linux community
  post questions on relevant discussion forums
  subscribe to discussion threads
  join local Linux groups
In August 1991, Linux Torvalds posted his announcement of Linux
The penguin is Linux's official mascot
Linus decided to use the GPL license created by Richard Stallman
The GPL license gives the user
  The freedom to use the software for any purpose
  The freedom to change the software to suit your needs
  The freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors
  The freedom to share the changes you make
These ideas fueled Linux's spread around the world
It forms the foundation of a thriving industry
In 1999, Red Hat stock tripled as they were the first Linux company to go public
Linux helped fuel the rise of the internet
Whenever something is this disruptive, there is bound to be competitive crossfire
The linux development community numbers in the thousands
You use Linux literally every time you go on the internet
Linux is in many devices that you use every day
The linux community has severa ways to connect with each other including:
  Linux User Groups (both local and online)
  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels such as pidgin and xchat
  online communities and discussion boards
  newsgroups and mailing lists
  Community events such as linuxcon and apachecon
The official linux.com website serves over one million unique visitors every month and has active sections on
  news
  community discussion threads
  free tutorials and user tips


SECTION 4: LINUX TERMINOLOGY
There are many unfamiliar terms that you may come across when you start to use linux
You need to be aware of some basic terms such as:
  kernel
  distribution
  boot loader
  service
  filesystem
  X window system
  desktop environment
  command line
The kernel is the glue between hardware and applications
considered the brain of the operating system e.g. the linux kernel
A distribution (distro) is a collection of software making up a linux-based OS
The bootloader is a program that boots the operating system
e.g. GRUB and ISOLinux
A service is a program that runs as a background process
e.g. httpd, named
A filesystem is a method for storing and organizing files
e.g. ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, NTFS
The X Window System provides the standard toolkit to build GUIs
The desktop environment is the GUI on top f the OS
The command line is an interface for typing commands on top of the operation system
The shell is the command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and tells the operating system how to process those inputs


SECTION 5: LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS

Suppose you have been assigned a project building a product for Linux
If we want the project to work on all linux systems, then we need to learn about different:
  components
  services
  configurations
that are associated with each distribution
A linux distribution is related to the linux kernel because it consists of the kernel plus all the other software tools
These tools can be used for
  file-related operations
  user management
  software package management
  generic proprietary applications
  Generic free applications
  Distro-specific applications
  manuals for applications
  support services
The current linux kernel and all past kernels can be found at linux.org
Various distros can be based on various kernel versions
Other essential tools of linux distributions include
  C/C++ compiler
  gdb debugger
  core system libraries needed for programs to run
  low-level interface for drawing graphics on the screen
  system for installing and updating the various components including the kernel itself
A vast variety of linux distros cater to different audiences and organizations depending on their specific needs
Large organizations tend to favor the commercially supported distros e.g. RHEL, SUSE, Ubuntu
CentOS is a popular free alternative to RHEL
Ubuntu and Fedora are popular in the education realm
Scientific linux is favored by the research community
Many commercial distros offer long-term fee-based support for their distros, hardware, and software certification
All major distros provide update services for keeping your system primed with security and bug fixes and online support


SUMMARY

The linux community is the far-reaching ecosystem of envelopers, vendors and users
They support and advance the linux OS
A linux distro consists of the kernel and other software tools for various tasks
