About the basic features of how computers work
We will look inside a computer and get a feel for how it works
Computers are extremely powerful and profoundly stupid
The computer world is a mechanical world
We connect the computer's mechanical side to our human side
The goal is to understand how computers work and to not be intimidated
At a high level, the operation of a computer is driven by code
Code is basically a just a series of instructions
The computer has the series of instructions and then just follows them
To run the code means to follow these instructions
To connect things like these instruction and red eye reduction
We have programmers to implement that
The computer programmer has to break it down into simple instructions
These instructions must be able to be used by the computer
Any useful feature on the computer was implemented by a developer
They break down all the information so a computer can do it
CS101 will look at what code can do
The programmer gets to be the creative side of this
The computer is the power side
Computers are getting more powerful and cheaper
