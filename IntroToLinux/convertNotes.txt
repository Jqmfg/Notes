we need to cover:
double new lines (should stay double new lines)
single new lines (should convert to single space and cover if we have a space there already)
lists
page line after h3

steps:
find triple lines and convert to double lines
find double lines and convert to (double_line)
find single line with "___" and convert to (line_break)
find single line with quad tab and convert to (line_quad_tab)
find single line with triple tab and convert to (line_triple_tab)
find single line with double tab and convert to (line_double_tab)
find single line with single tab and convert to (line_single_tab)
start replacement now
find two spaces and convert to single space
find single line with triple backtick and convert to (line_code_block)
find single space with line and convert to single space
find single line and convert to space
find (line_code_block) and convert to single line with triple backtick
find (line_single_tab) and convert to single line with a single tab
find (line_double_tab) and convert to single line with a double tab
find (line_triple_tab) and convert to single line with a triple tab
find (line_quad_tab) and convert to single line with a quad tab
find (line_break) and convert to single line with "___"
find (double_line) and convert to double lines
