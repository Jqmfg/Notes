# Chapter 12: Network Operations

### Introduction
___

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:
  * Explain many basic networking concepts including types of networks and addressing issues.
  * Know how to configure network interfaces and use basic networking utilites such as ` ifconfig `, ` ip `, ` ping `, ` route `, and ` traceroute `.
  * Use graphical and non-graphical browsers such as Lynx, w3m, Firefox, Chrome, and Epiphany.
  * Transfer files to and from clients and servers using both graphical and text mode applications such as Filezilla, ftp, sftp, curl, and wget.

### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO NETWORKING
___

A network is a group of computers and computing devices connected together through communication channels such as cables or wireless media.
The computers connected over a network may be located in the same geographical area or spread across the world.
A network is used to:
  * Allow the connected devices to communicate with each other.
  * Enable multiple users to share devices over the network such as printers and scanners.
  * Share and manage information across computers easily.

Most organizations have both an internal network and an Internet connection for users to communicate with machines and people outside the organization.
The Internet is the largest network in the world and is often called "the network of networks".

Devices attached to a network must have at least one unique network address identifier know as the IP (Internet Protocl) address.
The address is essential for routing packets of information through the network.
Exchanging information across the network requires using streams of bite-size packets, each of which contains a piece of the information going from one machine to another.
These packets contain data buffers together with headers which contain information about where the packet is going to and coming from, and where it fits in the sequence of packets that constitute the stream.
Networking protocols and software are rather complicated due to the diversity of machines and operating system they must deal with, as well as the fact that even very old standards must be supported.

There are two different types of IP addresses available: IPv4 (version 4) and IPv6 (version 6).
IPv4 is older and by far the more widely used, while IPv6 is newer and is designed to get past the limitations of the older standard and furnish many more possible addresses.
IPv4 uses 32-bits for addresses; there are only 4.3 billion unique addresses available.
Furthermore, many addresses are allotted and reserved, but not actually used.
IPv4 is becoming inadequate because the number of devices available on the global network has significantly increased over the past years.
IPv6 uses 128-bits for addresses; this allows for 3.4x10^38 unique addresses.
If you have a larger network of computers and want to add more, you may want to move to IPv6, because it provides more unique addresses.
However, it is difficult to move to IPv6 as the two protocols do not inter-operate.
Due to this, migrating equipment and addresses to IPv6 requires significant effort and hasn't been as fast as was originally intended.

A 32-bit IPv4 address is divided into four 8-bit sections called octets.
Example:
IP address | 172.16.31.46
- | -
Bit format | 10101100.00010000.00011111.00101110

Network addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.
Classes A, B, and C are classified into two parts: Network Addresses (Net ID) and Host addresses (Host ID).
The Net ID is used to identify the network, while the host ID is used to identify a host in the network.
Class D is used for special multicast applications (information is broadcast to multiple computers simultaneously) and Class E is reserved for future use.
in this section, we will learn about classes A, B, and C.

Class A addresses use the first octet of an IP address as their Net ID and use the other three octets as the Host ID.
The first bit of the first octet is always set to zero.
Thus you can only use 7-bits for unique network numbers.
As a result, there are a maximum of 126 Class A networks available (the addresses 00000000 and 11111111 are reserved.)
Not surprisingly, this was only feasible when there were very few unique networks with large numbers of hosts.
As the use of the Internet expanded, Classes B and C were added in order to accommodate the growing demand for independent networks.
Each Class A network can have up to 16.7 million unique hosts on its network.
The range of host addresses is from 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
The value of an octet, or 8-bits, can range from 0 to 255.

Class B addresses use the first two octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last two octets as the host ID.
The first two bits of the first octet are always set to binary 10, so there are a maximum of 16,384 (14-bits) Class B networks.
The first octet of a Class B address has values form 128 to 191.
The introduction of Class B networks expanded the number of networks, but it soon became clear that a further level would be needed.
Each Class B network can support a maximum of 65,536 unique hosts on its network.
The range of host addresses is from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255

Class C addresses use the first three octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last octet as their Host ID.
The first three bits of the first octet are set to binary 110, so almost 2.1 million (21-bits) Class C networks are available.
The first octet of Class C addresses has values from 192 to 223.
These are most common for smaller networks which don't have many unique hosts.
Each Class C network can support up to 256 (8-bits) unique hosts.
The range of host addresses is from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.
